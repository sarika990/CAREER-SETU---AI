## 🌟 Vision
**SkillBridge AI** is a transformative platform designed to solve the critical "Skill-to-Job" mismatch. By leveraging Industry 4.0 technologies (NLP, LLMs, and Data Analytics), we provide a localized, intelligent ecosystem for job seekers, training providers, and government agencies to synchronize their efforts and maximize national productivity.

---

## 🚀 Key Innovation Highlights

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **What makes us different?**
> Unlike standard job portals, SkillBridge AI uses **spaCy-driven NLP** to parse unstructured regional resumes and **Google Gemini LLM** to generate personalized, empathetic mock interview evaluations and career roadmaps that feel human-centric.

---

## 🛠️ Core AI Components

### 1. 📂 Intelligent Resume Scorer (ATS 2.0)
- **Deep Parsing**: Uses NLP (spaCy) to extract skills, experience levels, and contact data from uploaded documents.
- **ATS Compatibility**: Scores resumes against target roles and identifies specific "Missing Keywords" that standard parsers often miss.
- **Actionable Feedback**: Provides qualitative suggestions on how to improve professional impact.

### 2. 🗺️ Dynamic 30/60/90 Day Roadmaps
- **Knowledge Graph**: Maps user skill gaps to top-tier educational resources automatically.
- **Structured Learning**: Breaks down complex transitions (e.g., Clerk to Data Entry) into digestible monthly milestones.

### 3. 🎙️ AI-Powered Interview Coach
- **Realistic Simulations**: Generates role-based questions tailored to the user's specific career path.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Analyzes answers and provides scoring on technical correctness, confidence, and professionalism.

### 4. 📊 Workforce Analytics for Social Impact
- **Heatmaps**: Identifies regional skill clusters and "demand vs. supply" deficits at the district level.
- **Decision Support**: Enables NGOs and Government bodies to allocate training budgets where they are needed most.
